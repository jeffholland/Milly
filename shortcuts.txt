I'm a big fan of keyboard shortcuts, 
and I keep adding them to the program because it's easy and fun.


Here is a list of all of them.


return                 submit entry
shift+return           new line of text
cmd+i                  insert entry
cmd+s                  save
cmd+l                  load
cmd+c                  clear
cmd+backspace          delete top entry
cmd+shift+backspace    delete bottom entry
